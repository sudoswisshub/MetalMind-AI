            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

            <p>Own Ai is designed for local-first AI. This policy explains what data the app handles, how data is
                collected, how it is used, and when it is shared with third-party AI services.</p>

            <h2>1. Data the App Collects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chat and prompt content:</strong> Messages you type in chat.</li>
                <li><strong>Document content:</strong> Text extracted from files you choose to import.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice input/output data:</strong> Speech-to-text transcription and text-to-speech content.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model and app settings:</strong> Selected model, generation preferences, and consent flags.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Downloaded model files:</strong> Model weights and tokenizer files you choose to download.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How Data Is Collected</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Directly from you when you type prompts, speak, or import documents.</li>
                <li>From iOS frameworks for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and model availability checks.</li>
                <li>By local storage on your device (for chat history, settings, and model files).</li>
                <li>By network requests only when downloading model files or when Apple Intelligence is selected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To generate AI responses.</li>
                <li>To provide document question-answering and summaries.</li>
                <li>To save chat history and app preferences on your device.</li>
                <li>To download and manage on-device models you select.</li>
                <li>To support optional voice features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Third-Party AI Sharing and Consent</h2>

            <h3>4a. On-Device Models (MLX / Gemma 2 2B)</h3>
            <p>If you select an <strong>MLX local model</strong> such as <strong>Gemma 2 2B</strong> (published by
                Google LLC),
                all AI inference (prompt processing, response generation) runs <strong>100% on your device</strong>.
                <strong>No personal data — including prompts, chat messages, document text, voice input, or conversation
                    history — is sent to Google LLC or any third-party AI service.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The app asks for your explicit permission before using any model for the first time. A consent screen
                clearly identifies what data is processed, confirms it stays on-device, and requires your approval
                before
                proceeding.
            </p>

            <h3>4b. Apple Intelligence</h3>
            <p>If you select <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>, your prompt text, attached document text, and
                conversation context may be sent to
                <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> (including Apple Private Cloud Compute) to generate responses. Apple Inc.
                provides
                the same or equal protection for your data as described in this policy, ensuring that your personal data
                is
                never stored or accessible to Apple for model training or diagnostics without your explicit system-level
                consent.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Specific Data Shared:</strong> Prompts, conversation context, and text content extracted from
                attached documents.</p>
            <p><strong>In-app permission control:</strong> Before first use of Apple Intelligence, the app shows a
                disclosure sheet
                that identifies data categories, the recipient (Apple Inc.), and asks for your explicit permission.
            </p>

            <h3>4c. Model File Downloads</h3>
            <p>When you choose to download a model, the app makes a network request to <strong>Hugging Face
                    Inc.</strong>
                (a model hosting provider) to retrieve the model files. This request may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your IP address</li>
                <li>Device request headers (e.g. operating system version)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>No chat messages, prompts, documents, voice input, or any personal content is sent during model
                    downloads.</strong></p>

            <h2>5. Other Third-Party Services</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No ad/analytics SDKs:</strong> The app does not include third-party advertising or tracking
                    SDKs.</li>
                <li><strong>No other third-party AI services:</strong> The app does not send data to any AI service
                    other than Apple Inc. (when Apple Intelligence is selected by the user).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Retention and Control</h2>
            <p>Chat history, extracted document data, and settings are stored locally on your device. You can delete
                conversations or reset app data from within the app.</p>
