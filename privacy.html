            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 1, 2026</p>

            <p>At Own Ai, your privacy is not a feature—it is our foundation. We believe that your conversations with AI
                are personal and should remain that way. <strong>Your data never leaves your device.</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Zero Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, conversation history, or usage analytics to any
                remote servers. Own Ai operates entirely offline for its core functions.</p>

            <h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>
            <p>All AI inference occurs locally on your device hardware.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple Intelligence:</strong> Uses on-device models provided by iOS.</li>
                <li><strong>Local LLMs (MLX/Gemma):</strong> Run directly on your device's Silicon (GPU/Neural Engine).
                </li>
            </ul>
            No text, voice recordings, or document contents are sent to the cloud for processing.</p>

            <h2>3. Document Privacy (RAG)</h2>
            <p>When you upload documents for analysis, they are processed and indexed locally. The extracted text and
                vector embeddings remain strictly within your device's secure storage.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Own Ai does not include third-party tracking, advertising, or analytics SDKs. We have no way of knowing
                how you use the app or what you discuss with the AI.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention & Control</h2>
            <p>Your chat history is saved only in your device's local database. You can clear individual conversations
                or reset the entire app history at any time through the settings menu. Once deleted, this data is gone
                and cannot be recovered by us.</p>

            <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at <a
