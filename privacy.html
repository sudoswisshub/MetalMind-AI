            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

            <p>At Own Ai, your privacy is not a feature—it is our foundation. We believe that your conversations with AI
                are personal and should remain that way. Most processing happens on-device, and when you choose Apple
                Intelligence, your content may be processed by Apple to generate responses.</p>

            <h2>1. Zero Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, conversation history, or usage analytics to any
                remote servers. If you choose Apple Intelligence, Apple may process your prompts and any documents you
                choose to analyze to generate responses. We do not receive or store that content on our servers.</p>

            <h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>
            <p>AI inference and speech processing primarily occur locally on your device hardware, with Apple
                Intelligence able to use Apple Private Cloud Compute to generate responses when selected.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple Intelligence & Speech:</strong> Speech-to-text and text-to-speech are performed
                    on-device using Apple's Speech Framework. Apple Intelligence responses may be processed by Apple
                    (including Apple Private Cloud Compute) to generate outputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Local LLMs (MLX/Gemma):</strong> Models are downloaded from public repositories (e.g.
                    Hugging Face) and stored locally. Inference runs directly on your device's Silicon (GPU/Neural
                    Engine). Downloading models uses network access but does not transmit your prompts or documents.
                </li>
            </ul>
            When using local models, no text, voice recordings, or document contents are sent to the cloud for
            processing.</p>

            <h2>3. Document Privacy (RAG)</h2>
            <p>When you upload documents for analysis, they are processed and indexed locally. The extracted text and
                vector embeddings remain strictly within your device's secure storage. If you choose Apple Intelligence,
                document content may be processed by Apple to generate responses.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Own Ai does not include third-party tracking, advertising, or analytics SDKs. Apple Intelligence is
                provided by Apple and may process content when selected. Local models are downloaded from public model
                repositories, but your prompts and documents are not sent to those services.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention & Control</h2>
            <p>Your chat history is saved only in your device's local database. You can clear individual conversations
                or reset the entire app history at any time through the settings menu. Once deleted, this data is gone
                and cannot be recovered by us.</p>

            <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at <a
