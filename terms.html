            <h2>2. AI Content Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Own Ai utilizes advanced machine learning models (Apple Intelligence and MLX). You understand that:
            <ul>
                <li>AI can "hallucinate" and provide factually incorrect information.</li>
                <li>The AI may occasionally produce biased or inappropriate content.</li>
                <li>You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of AI-generated content before relying on it.
                </li>

            </p>

            <h2>3. Service Availability</h2>
            <p>Performance depends on your device hardware. We do not guarantee that the app will function on all
                devices or that features like Apple Intelligence will be available if disabled in system settings.</p>
